        Hey Jana,<br><br>
        I know this was revealed to your mom in the worst way possible and I'm trying my best to make things right.
        I will call your mom along with my aunt for some woman to woman experience and I will make everything right again.<br><br>
        If your mom is not okay with a relationship then at least it'd make things calmer and allow me to have my chance with engagement and marriage later on,
        so please don't be upset and I will fix everything insha'allah.<br><br>
        Hopefully your mom is understanding and would let me talk and deliver the idea and intention behind everything.<br><br>
        Love you,<br>
        M.
